# IMDB-movie-review-classifier

This model uses the IMDB dataset from https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/, consisting of 50,000 movie reviews, split in half for training and testing (25,000 + 25,000). Each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

The goal is to create a RNN model and evaluate its performance, with the focus to evaluate text predictions.
